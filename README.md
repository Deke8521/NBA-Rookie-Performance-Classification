# NBA-Rookie-Performance-Classification
This project involves applying various machine learning algorithms to the dataset nba_rookie_data.csv to predict the career length of NBA rookies.
The target variable, Target_5Yrs, indicates whether a player's career length is at least 5 years (1) or less than 5 years (0). The classification problem is to predict if a player will last 5 years in the NBA. The project includes the implementation of Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks, along with an analysis of the results and a comparison of the approaches used.

# Project Objectives
## Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
Load and explore the nba_rookie_data.csv dataset.
Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

## Model Development:
Apply Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks to the classification problem.
Use as many features as possible to evaluate if the models improve with additional data.

## Model Visualization:
Visualize the models and their predictions to illustrate relationships and performance.

## Model Evaluation:
Assess the effectiveness of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Analyze the results and discuss the effectiveness of each model.
Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms.

## Model Improvement and Conclusion:
Identify areas for improvement and potential enhancements for each model.
Conclude on the modelâ€™s performance and its practical implications.
Discuss the relationship between the predictor and target variables.

## Dataset
The dataset, nba_rookie_data.csv, contains the following features related to NBA rookie performance and the target variable:

Feature_1: Description of feature 1
Feature_2: Description of feature 2
...
Target_5Yrs: Target variable (1 if career length >= 5 years, 0 if career length < 5 years)
